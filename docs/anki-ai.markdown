### Abstract

[Anki](https://ankiweb.net/decks) is a popular flashcard app, but it takes a lot of time to make or edit cards. I wrote an Anki plugin so that you could update your cards using LLMs, by sending data from the card to the LLM and saving the respond to the card. You can use it to generate examples, summarize information, provide step-by-step derivations, and more. My personal favorite use case is to generate interesting example sentences at my exact level for language learning.

There are some similar paid plugins, but I felt strongly about creating a free option.

In just three months it has reached over 400 downloads and is ranked in the top 20% of all Anki plugins.

### Results

* Over 400 downloads, only positive feedback
* Supports multiple LLM providers and designed to easily integrate more
* Implemented a generic interface so it is easy to send specific Fields from/to the flashcard
