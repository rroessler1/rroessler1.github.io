# WhereAmI? A Mixed Reality application for Indoor Localization

This was a group project for the Mixed Reality class at ETH. We built an Augmented Reality for a Magic Leap 2 device that allowed the user to locate their position indoors and navigate in a previously mapped environment.

We built on top of the Hierarchical-Localization algorithm. Our backend code is [here](https://github.com/rroessler1/Hierarchical-Localization/tree/arni_changes), forked off of the original Hierarchical-Localization branch. The Unity and application code is [here](https://github.com/Matezzzz/WhereAmI), though I did not contribute to this at all.
